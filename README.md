#Garden Path Sentences
This project uses the spaCy library to perform named entity recognition on garden path sentences.

Description
Garden path sentences are grammatically correct sentences, but they can be misinterpreted due to the way they are structured. For example, the sentence "The old man the boats." can be interpreted as either "The old man owns the boats" or "The old man threw the boats."
This project uses the spaCy library to tokenize and perform named entity recognition on garden path sentences. This allows us to see how the spaCy library interprets these sentences and how it can help us to understand the different ways that they can be interpreted.

Installation
To install this project, you will need to have the spaCy library installed. You can install the spaCy library by following the instructions on the spaCy website.
Once you have installed the spaCy library, you can clone this repository from GitHub.

Usage
To use this project, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

python garden_path_sentences.py

This will run the code in the garden_path_sentences.py file and print out the results of the named entity recognition.
